title: "Deep Lexicon and Thought Retention (15 minutes)"

## Why itâ€™s needed:
The deep lexicon involves more sophisticated and less frequently used words, which are necessary 
for conveying complex ideas and nuanced thoughts. The ability to engage with deeper levels of
thought for longer periods enhances both intellectual depth and expressive power. Developing 
a deep lexicon prevents communication from being shallow or superficial, allowing more profound 
insights to emerge.

## How it works:
Writing down complex thoughts without editing as they form helps capture deeper layers of thinking. 
This practice trains the mind to hold onto and explore complex ideas for longer periods, improving 
thought retention. Answering deep, philosophical questions each day challenges the mind to articulate 
abstract and intricate ideas clearly, ensuring a more profound level of speech and writing.
