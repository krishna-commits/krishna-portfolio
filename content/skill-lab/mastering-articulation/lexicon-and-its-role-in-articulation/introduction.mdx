title: "Lexicon and Its Role in Articulation"
description: The lexicon, both surface and deep, forms the core of articulate communication. It refers to the vocabulary a person recognizes and uses, divided into frequently accessed (surface) words and deeper, more sophisticated (deep) words. Mastering both is essential for nuanced, expressive speech.

## Surface Lexicon
The surface lexicon consists of words used regularly in everyday speech. These are words that come to mind quickly and make up the majority of a personâ€™s conversational vocabulary. Though these words are essential, over-reliance on them can lead to repetitive and uninspired speech.

## Deep Lexicon
The deep lexicon contains words that are known but seldom used. These words allow for richer, more precise expression of ideas but require intentional practice to become part of everyday vocabulary. For example, while many know words like "savory" or "nuanced," they default to simpler terms like "good" or "nice."

## The Role of Thought Retention
Retention of sophisticated vocabulary is necessary for accessing deeper words and concepts during speech. Without retention, even learned words will slip into disuse. Thought retention involves creating mental pathways through repetition, imagery, and contextual association to embed words into the active vocabulary.

## The Importance of a Balanced Lexicon
Balancing surface and deep lexicons is key to eloquence. Over-reliance on either diminishes communication: surface lexicon alone can make speech sound shallow, while excessive use of deep words can obscure meaning. An articulate speaker masters both.

### Application
- Real-Life Application: During conversations, pause before speaking to consciously choose words from both the surface and deep lexicon.
- Self-Challenge: Aim to use at least two new words from your deep lexicon daily, ensuring they fit naturally into the flow of speech.

### Review and Reflection
- What new words have entered the surface lexicon this week?
- Did pauses before speaking lead to better word choice?
- How often were deep lexicon words used in daily conversations?
