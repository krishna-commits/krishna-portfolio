At this point you have prepared a list of topics, and a reading list. Now it’s time to choose a topic.

**ENTER TOPIC HERE**
* 1. 

Here’s another rule. When you write your first draft, it should be longer than the final version. This is so that you have some extra writing to throw away. You want to have something to throw away after the first draft so that you only have to keep what is good. It is NOT faster to try to write exactly as many words as you need when you first sit down to write. Trying to do so merely makes you too aware of what you are writing. This concern will slow you down. Aim at producing a first draft that is 25% longer than the final draft is supposed to be. If your final work is to be 1000 words, then write that (or four pages) below. The word document will automatically add 25% to the length you specify. 

Now specify the length of your essay.

* *WORDS:*
* *PAGES:*
* *ADD 25% TO THE ABOVE LENGTHS*

Now you have to write an outline. This is the most difficult part of writing an essay, and it’s not optional. The outline of an essay is like the skeleton of a body. It provides its fundamental form and structure. Furthermore, the outline is basically the argument (with the sentences themselves and the words serving that argument).

A thousand-word essay requires a ten-sentence outline. However, the fundamental outline of an essay should not get much longer than fifteen sentences, even if the essay is several thousand words or more in length. This is because it is difficult to keep an argument of more than that length in mind at one time so that you can assess the quality of its structure. So, write a ten to fifteen sentence outline of your essay, and if it is longer than a thousand words, then make sub-outlines for each primary outline sentence. Here is an example of a good simple outline:

* Topic: Who was Abraham Lincoln?
* Why is Abraham Lincoln worthy of remembrance?
* What were the crucial events of his childhood?
* Of his adolescence?
* Of his young adulthood?
* How did he enter politics?
* What were his major challenges?
* What were the primary political and economic issues of his time?
* Who were his enemies?
* How did he deal with them?
* What were his major accomplishments?
* How did he die?

Here is an example of a good longer outline (for a three thousand word essay):
* Topic: What is capitalism?
* How has capitalism been defined?
    * Author 1
    * Author 2
    * Author 3
* Where and when did capitalism develop?
    * Country 1
    * Country 2
* How did capitalism develop in the first 50 years after its origin?
    * How did capitalism develop in the second 50 years after its origin? 
    * (Repeat as necessary)
* Historical precursors?
    * (choose as many centuries as necessary)
* Advantages of capitalism?
    * Wealth generation 
    * Technological advancement
    * Personal freedom
* Disadvantages of capitalism?
    * Unequal distribution
    * Pollution and other externalized costs
* Alternatives to capitalism?
    * Fascism
    * Communism
* Consequences of these alternatives?
* Potential future developments?
* Conclusion

Beware of the tendency to write trite, repetitive and clichéd introductions and conclusions. It is often useful to write a stock intro (what is the purpose of this essay? How is it going to proceed?) and a stock conclusion (How did this essay proceed? What was its purpose?) but they should usually then be thrown away. Write your outline here. Try for one outline heading per 100 words of essay length. You can add subdivisions, as in the example regarding capitalism, above.
