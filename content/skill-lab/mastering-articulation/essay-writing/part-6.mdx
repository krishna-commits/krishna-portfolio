title: 'Part 6: Editing and arranging of sentences within paragraphs'

Copy the first paragraph of your first draft here:

### Paragraph 1:

Now, place each sentence on its own line, so it looks like this (this example is taken from the first paragraph on capitalism, above):

> Something as complex as capitalism cannot be easily defined. 

> Different authors have each offered their opinion. 

> Liberal or conservative thinkers stress the importance of private property and the ownership rights that accompany such property as key to capitalism (REFERENCE, 19XX). 

> Such private property (including valuable goods and the means by which they are produced) can be traded, freely, with other property owners, in a market where the price is set by public demand, rather than by any central agency. 

> Liberal and conservative thinkers stress efficiency of production, as well as quality, and consider profit the motive for efficiency. 

> They believe that lower cost is a desirable feature of production, and that fair competition helps ensure desirably lower prices. 

Now, write another version of each sentence, under each sentence, like this:

> Liberal and conservative thinkers stress efficiency of production, as well as quality, and consider profit the motive for efficiency. 

> Liberal and conservative thinkers alike stress the importance of quality and efficiency, and see them as properly rewarded by profit. 

In this example, the meaning of the sentence has been changed slightly, during the rewrite. It may be that the second sentence flows better than the first, and is also more precise and meaningful. See if you can make each sentence you have written better, in a similar manner: 

* Better would mean shorter and simpler (as all unnecessary words should be eliminated). There is almost nothing a novice writer can do that will improve his or her writing more rapidly than writing very short sentences. See if you can cut the length of each sentence by 15-25%. Remember, earlier, you tried to make your essay longer than necessary. Here you can start cleaning it up.

* Better would mean that each word is precisely and exactly the right word. Don’t be tempted to use any word that you would be uncomfortable to use in spoken conversation. Often, new writers try to impress their readers with their vocabulary. This often backfires when words are used that are technically correct but whose connotation is not, or that are unsuitable within the context of the sentence, paragraph or full essay. An expert writer will spot such flaws immediately, and see them for what they are: forms of camouflage and deception. Write clearly at a vocabulary level you have mastered (with maybe a bit of stretching, to produce improvement). 

Read each sentence aloud, and listen to how it sounds. If it’s awkward, see if you can say it a different, better way. Listen to what you said, and then write it down. Rewrite each sentence. Once you have done this with all the sentences, read the old versions and the new versions, and replace the old with the new if the new is better. Then copy the new paragraph here:
* New paragraph 1:
* Repeat for each paragraph:
* New paragraph 2:
* New paragraph 3: 
* New paragraph 4:
* New paragraph 5 (etc.): 

Now you are going to try to improve each of those paragraphs. Copy them again here, unchanged (you are doing this so that you can easily compare the improved paragraphs to the originals, so that you can be sure they are truly improved, before you keep them):
* New paragraph 1 (copy):
* New paragraph 2 (copy):
* New paragraph 3 (copy): 
* New paragraph 4 (copy):
* New paragraph 5 (copy) (etc.): 

Start with paragraph 1. Break it up into single sentences, as you did before. Now check to see if the sentences are in the best possible order, within each paragraph. Drag and drop them, or cut and paste them, into better order. 

You can also eliminate sentences that are no longer necessary. When you are satisfied with the first paragraph (which means that the sentences are necessary, short and punchy, and in the correct order) then go ahead to the next paragraph and do the same thing.
