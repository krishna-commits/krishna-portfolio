Now, copy all of the new, improved paragraphs that you have edited here:
* New improved paragraph 1:
* New improved paragraph 2:
* New improved paragraph 3: 
* New improved paragraph 4:
* New improved paragraph 5 (etc.): 

Now you are going to try to improve the order of those new, improved paragraphs. Copy them here, again, unchanged. 
* New improved paragraph 1 (copy):
* New improved paragraph 2 (copy):
* New improved paragraph 3 (copy): 
* New improved paragraph 4 (copy):
* New improved paragraph 5 (copy) (etc.): 

Now look at the order of the paragraphs themselves (as you just did with the sentences within each paragraph). It may well be that by now in the editing process, you will find that the order of the subtopics within your original outline is no longer precisely appropriate, and that some re-ordering of those sub-topics is called for. So, move around the new improved paragraph (copies) above, until they are ordered more appropriately than they were.
