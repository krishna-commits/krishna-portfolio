They allow speakers to craft clear, engaging, and persuasive messages while making deliberate choices at each stage of their preparation. Originating from the ancient Roman orator Cicero, these timeless principles still apply to all forms of public speaking today. By mastering them, you will become a more confident and articulate communicator, capable of adapting your message to any audience or occasion.
