title: Arrangement
description: Arrangement is the organization of your ideas into a coherent, logical structure. The way you arrange your content determines how easily your audience can follow and absorb your message. Think of this as placing furniture in a roomâ€”everything should flow naturally, so that your main points are clear, easy to follow, and persuasive.

- Deciding the order of your arguments and points.
- Following traditional formats (e.g., introduction, body, conclusion) or customizing your structure to fit the message.
