title: Style
description: Style refers to the language choices you make to convey your message. It determines the tone, emotion, and level of formality in your speech. Style also helps set the mood for your audience, and it should fit both the subject matter and the occasion. Whether you choose a plain, information-driven approach or a more emotive, poetic style depends on the context and the effect you want to create.
