title: Delivery
description: Delivery is the final step, where all the preparation comes together as you present your speech. It involves not only what you say but how you say it. Your non-verbal cues—eye contact, gestures, body language, tone, and pacing—all play a crucial role in engaging the audience and driving your message home.

## Key Focus Areas:
- Controlling your voice (volume, pitch, speed) for maximum impact.
- Using body language (gestures, posture, facial expressions) to enhance your message.
- Creating a dynamic, engaging presence that captivates your audience.
