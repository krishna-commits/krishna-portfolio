# Speech Development

### 1. "Yet we are the movers and shakers / Of the world for ever, it seems."
Speech: The greatest revolutions in human history did not begin with armies or empires. They started in the hearts and minds of a few individuals—those who dared to dream of a different world. It is not the conformists, but the ones who see beyond the present constraints, who ultimately steer the course of humanity. Though often isolated and misunderstood, it is the artist, the innovator, and the dreamer who hold the real power. Yet we are the movers and shakers of the world forever, it seems.

### 2. "For each age is a dream that is dying, / Or one that is coming to birth."
Speech: Every era in history comes to an inevitable end, but its conclusion is never final. With the fall of one age, there is always the rise of something new—a fresh vision, a new dawn. While some lament the passing of what was, others look to the horizon, where a new dream begins to take shape. Each era is a reflection of the dreams that fuel it, and when those dreams fade, another vision emerges to take its place. For each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.

### 3. "A breath of our inspiration / Is the life of each generation;"
Speech: Every great leap forward in human civilization has been sparked by a moment of inspiration. Whether it was a new invention, a groundbreaking idea, or a revolutionary piece of art, it was the inspired few who breathed life into the course of history. The labor of builders and the strength of leaders may shape the physical world, but it is the dreamers who breathe life into the soul of each generation. A breath of our inspiration is the life of each generation.

### 4. "But on one man's soul it hath broken, / A light that doth not depart;"
Speech: It takes only one person, one spark of insight, to ignite the flames of change. While many may live their lives in pursuit of the ordinary, occasionally, one individual rises with a vision so powerful that it cannot be ignored. This individual carries a light that transforms everything it touches, a light that others may not see at first but will feel its warmth and energy over time. But on one man’s soul it hath broken, a light that doth not depart.

### 5. "And therefore to-day is thrilling / With a past day's late fulfilling;"
Speech: What we achieve today is not just the product of our own effort—it is the fulfillment of the dreams of those who came before us. Their hopes, once dismissed or ridiculed, have now found their way into reality through our actions. The world we live in today is the embodiment of yesterday's visionaries, those who could see far beyond their own time. And therefore today is thrilling with a past day's late fulfilling.

### 6. "For we are afar with the dawning / And the suns that are not yet high."
Speech: Visionaries exist not in the present, but in the future. They are like early risers who see the dawn before others have even stirred from sleep. While the world focuses on the problems of today, these individuals are already shaping the solutions of tomorrow. They perceive possibilities that have not yet formed and dream of futures that others cannot even imagine. For we are afar with the dawning, and the suns that are not yet high.
