The structure of your sentences can make or break the persuasiveness of your message. Structural rhetorical devices organize your ideas in ways that are smooth, cohesive, and logically sound. These devices often reinforce the authority of your message through repetition or contrast. Crucial structural devices include:

## Parallelism
The repetition of similar sentence structures to create balance and cohesion.
## Antithesis
A contrast between two opposing ideas in the same sentence to highlight a point and increase its impact.
