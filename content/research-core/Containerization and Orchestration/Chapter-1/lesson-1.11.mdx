### Here are the three documentation sets:
- Man pages
- Info pages
- /usr/share/docs

## The Man Page 
> man ls
### What can you discover via the man pages?
- The command's summary
- Options and explanations
- Examples
- Author and maintainer
### Search Capabilities of man page
- Man pages include a powerful set of search capabilities to help you find exactly what you need. 
- Once the man page is displayed, type a forward slash `/` to enable keyword searching. 
- Simply enter the word you're looking for after the slash and select Enter. 
- Use the `n` and `N` keys to find the next or previous example of the keyword. 
- Use `Ctrl+C` to end the search.
### Organization of man page
Man pages are organized into the following sections:
- User commands (section 1)
- System calls (section 2)
- C library functions (section 3)
- Devices and special files (section 4)
- File formats and conventions (section 5)
- Games (section 6)
- Miscellanea (section 7)
- System administration tools and daemons (section 8)
### Keys used in man page (manual page)
- Up, down arrow key to navigate upwards and downwards. 
- `G` to jump to the bottom of the page.
- `g` to jump to the top of the page.
- `q` to quit or exit from man page. 
- `/text` to search a text (Forward Search : Top --> Bottom)
- `?text` to search a text (Reverse Search : Bottom --> Top)
- `n` to locate next occurance of the searched text
- `N` to locate next occurance of the searched text in reverse direction


## The info command
The info pages play a similar role to man pages, though they tend to be a little more user-friendly. The man pages are basically a short, terse reference, while info pages tend more toward readability and deeper explanations. The info page system also supports basic linking between documents for easier cross-referencing. This provides a more structured and readable documentation set.
