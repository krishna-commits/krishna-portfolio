The grep command is one of the most useful commands in a Linux terminal environment. The name grep stands for “global regular expression print”. This means that you can use grep to check whether the input it receives matches a specified pattern.

- [ ]: Matches any one of a set characters
- [ ] with hyphen: Matches any one of a range characters
- ^: The pattern following it must occur at the beginning of each line
- ^ with [ ] : The pattern must not contain any character in the set specified
- $: The pattern preceding it must occur at the end of each line
- . (dot): Matches any one character
- \ (backslash): Ignores the special meaning of the character following it
- *: zero or more occurrences of the previous character
- (dot).*: Nothing or any numbers of characters.

### Example File: 
```bash
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ cat example_file 
Newa
Newb
Newc
Newd
Newe
Newf
Newg
Newh
```

### Example 1: [ ] : Matches any one of a set characters
```bash
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "New[a,b,c]" example_file 
Newa
Newb
Newc
```
```bash
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "New[h][d]" example_file 
Newhdef
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "New[h][def]" example_file 
Newhdef
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "New[h][defghi]" example_file 
Newhdef
Newhghi
```

### Example 2: Use [ ] with hyphen: Matches any one of a range characters
```bash 
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "New[0-1][d-o]" example_file 
New0def
New0ghi
New0jkl
New0mno
New1def
New1ghi
New1jkl
New1mno
```

### Example 3:  Use ^: The pattern following it must occur at the beginning of each line
```bash /old/2-6
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "^old" example_file 
old1file
old2image
old3audio
old4video
old5readme

[sanjeeb@serverB test]$ cat testfile
new1
new2
new3
new4
new5
new6
new7
new8
new9
This is new file1
This is new file2

# This is comment 1
# This is comment 2

[sanjeeb@serverB test]$ grep "^[#]"  testfile
# This is comment 1
# This is comment 2
[sanjeeb@serverB test]$ grep "^[^#]"  testfile
new1
new2
new3
new4
new5
new6
new7
new8
new9
This is new file1
This is new file2

```

### Example 4: Use ^ with [ ]: The pattern must not contain any character in the set specified
```bash 
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "^[a-d]" example_file 
a boy
bad boy
cute puppy
dead plant
```
### Example 5: Use $: The pattern preceding it must occur at the end of each line
```bash /y/2-7 
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "y$" example_file 
a boy
bad boy
cute puppy
jersey
lonely
money
```
```bash  /oy/2-4
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "oy$" example_file 
a boy
bad boy
```

### Example 6: Use . (dot): Matches any one character
```bash /boy/ /bay/
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "b.y$" example_file 
a boy
bad boy
bengal bay
```

### Example 7: Use \ (backslash): Ignores the special meaning of the character following it
```bash caption="We can see that the special character is not ignored so prints both h and 2 "
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "New.pqr" example_file 
Newhpqr
New2pqr
New.pqr
```
```bash caption="By adding Backslash"
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "New\.\pqr" example_file 
New.pqr
```

### Example 8: Use *: zero or more occurrences of the previous character
```bash
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "kni*" example_file 
knife 
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep "kni*f*" example_file 
knife 
```

### Example 9: Use (dot).*: Nothing or any numbers of characters.
```bash /New/ /boy/2-4
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep ".*abc" example_file 
Newhabc
New0abc
New1abc
New$abc
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ grep ".*boy" example_file
