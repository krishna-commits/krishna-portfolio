## Redirection Operators
The Linux command prompt offers users access to a wide range of useful tools, with shells supporting advanced methods for handling their output. By utilizing pipes and redirects, users can manipulate the output of a program, either sending it to a file or another program. Here are some basic tools and their usage:
- **> filename** → Redirects the standard output to the given file ( overwrites the file if the file already exists )
- **>> filename** → Appends the standard output at the bottom of the given file ( does not overwrite the content of the file if the file already exists )
- **2> filename** → Redirects the standard error to the given file ( overwrites content of the file if the file already exists)
- **2>> filename** → Appends the standard error at the bottom of the given file ( does not overwrite content of the file if the file already exists ) 
- **> filename 2>&1** → Redirects both the standard output and standard error to the given file
- **< filename** → Receives the standard input from the given file

### Example 1: Save the details of recently created 4 users into /root/usersinfo file. 
```bash 
[root@client ~]# tail -4 /etc/passwd > userinfo 

[root@client ~]# cat userinfo 
sanjeeb:x:1000:1000:Sanjeeb KC:/home/sanjeeb:/bin/bash
apache:x:48:48:Apache:/usr/share/httpd:/sbin/nologin
rpc:x:32:32:Rpcbind Daemon:/var/lib/rpcbind:/sbin/nologin
rpcuser:x:29:29:RPC Service User:/var/lib/nfs:/sbin/nologin
```
### Example 2: Save the details of those users who use bash shell into /root/usersinfo file. Make sure that the existing content of the file is not lost. 

```bash
[root@client ~]# grep /bin/bash /etc/passwd >> userinfo 

[root@client ~]# cat userinfo 
sanjeeb:x:1000:1000:Sanjeeb KC:/home/sanjeeb:/bin/bash
apache:x:48:48:Apache:/usr/share/httpd:/sbin/nologin
rpc:x:32:32:Rpcbind Daemon:/var/lib/rpcbind:/sbin/nologin
rpcuser:x:29:29:RPC Service User:/var/lib/nfs:/sbin/nologin
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
sanjeeb:x:1000:1000:Sanjeeb KC:/home/sanjeeb:/bin/bash
```

### Example 3: As sanjeeb, run the command ‘find /etc –name group’ and save the error message into /home/sanjeeb/grouperror file. 

```bash 
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ find /etc -name group 2> grouperror
/etc/iproute2/group
/etc/group

[sanjeeb@client ~]$ ls
Desktop  dfout  Documents  Downloads  grouperror  Music  Pictures  Public  scripts  Templates  Videos

[sanjeeb@client ~]$ cat grouperror

find: ‘/etc/lvm/archive’: Permission denied

find: ‘/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/sudoers.d’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/audit’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/firewalld’: Permission denied
```

### Example 4: As sanjeeb, run the command ‘find /etc –name profile’ and ensure that only output is displayed on the screen and the error is lost.
```bash 
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ find /etc -name profile 2> /dev/null
/etc/lvm/profile
/etc/profile
/etc/dconf/profile
```

### Example 5: Search the pattern ‘ful’ in the file /usr/share/dict/words and save the output into the file /root/ful_out.u
```bash 
[root@client ~]# grep ful /usr/share/dict/words > /root/ful_out 

[root@client ~]# cat ful_out 
abuseful
abusefully
abusefulness
...
```

### Example 6: Using 2>&1
```bash
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ ls folder1 >> test_out  2>&1
[sanjeeb@client ~]$ cat test_out 
ls: cannot open directory 'folder1': Permission denied
ls: cannot open directory 'folder1': Permission denied
ls: cannot open directory 'folder1': Permission denied
ls: cannot open directory 'folder1': Permission denied
ls: cannot open directory 'folder1': Permission denied
