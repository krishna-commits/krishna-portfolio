#### Listing the available tuning profiles 
```bash 
[root@server ~]# tuned-adm list 
Available profiles:
- accelerator-performance     - Throughput performance based tuning with disabled higher latency STOP states
- aws                         - Optimize for aws ec2 instances
- balanced                    - General non-specialized tuned profile
- balanced-battery            - Balanced profile biased towards power savings changes for battery
- desktop                     - Optimize for the desktop use-case
- hpc-compute                 - Optimize for HPC compute workloads
- intel-sst                   - Configure for Intel Speed Select Base Frequency
- latency-performance         - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption
- network-latency             - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption, focused on low latency network performance
- network-throughput          - Optimize for streaming network throughput, generally only necessary on older CPUs or 40G+ networks
- optimize-serial-console     - Optimize for serial console use.
- powersave                   - Optimize for low power consumption
- throughput-performance      - Broadly applicable tuning that provides excellent performance across a variety of common server workloads
- virtual-guest               - Optimize for running inside a virtual guest
- virtual-host                - Optimize for running KVM guests
Current active profile: virtual-guest
```

#### List the currently active tuning profile
```bash
[root@server ~]# tuned-adm active
Current active profile: virtual-guest
```

#### Change/Switch the Tuning Profile 
```bash 
[root@server ~]# tuned-adm profile hpc-compute 
[root@server ~]# tuned-adm active 
Current active profile: hpc-compute
```

#### Recommend the suitable profile for the system 
```bash 
[root@server ~]# tuned-adm recommend 
virtual-guest
```

#### Switch to the recommended profile 
```bash 
[root@server ~]# tuned-adm profile virtual-guest 
[root@server ~]# tuned-adm active 
Current active profile: virtual-guest
```
