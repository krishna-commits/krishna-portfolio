## Software Architecture Overview

Software architecture refers to the structures of a software system and the discipline involved in creating these structures. Each structure is composed of the following:
* **Software Elements:** Fundamental components of the system.
* **Relations Among Elements:** How these components interact or depend on each other.
* **Properties of Elements:** Characteristics or features of the software components.
* **Properties of Relations:** Attributes of the interactions or dependencies among elements.

### Blueprint for Development
Acts as a blueprint for the system and the development project.
Outlines the tasks required for design teams, ensuring organized and efficient execution.

### Definition of Software Architecture
The software architecture of a program or computing system is:
* The structure(s) of the system.
* Comprising software elements, their externally visible properties, and the relationships among them.

## Monolithic Architecture
* The term "monolith" originates from the ancient word for a large single block of stone.
* In software engineering, monolithic architecture refers to a single, indivisible unit.
* It follows a traditional approach where the entire application is developed as a single, self-contained unit.

### Key Characteristics

* **Unified Structure:**
    * All components of the software are combined into a single program running on a single platform.
    * Functions and processes are managed in one place.

* **Composition of a Monolithic Application:**
    * **Database:** Centralized data storage for the application.
    * **Client-side User Interface:** The front-end or interface users interact with.
    * **Server-side Application:** The back-end logic and processes.

* **Concept:**
    * The application combines different components into a single program.
    * All parts (UI, logic, database) work as a unified system.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture
* **Advantages:**
    * Simpler to **develop** and **deploy** initially.
    * Easier to **test** as it is a single unified application.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * **Scalability issues:** Difficult to scale specific components independently.
    * **Maintenance challenges:** As the application grows, updating or debugging becomes harder.
    * **Tight coupling:** Changes in one part may require changes in the entire system.

## Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a set of principles and methodologies for designing and developing software as interoperable services.

* Services are well-defined business functionalities, built as **reusable software components**.
* **Key Benefit:** Reusability for different purposes.

### Anatomy of a Service:
* **New Service:** Built from scratch.
* **Wrapped Legacy:** Existing functionality repurposed as a service.
* **Composite Service:** Combines multiple services into one

### Components of Service-Oriented Architecture

* **Service:**
    * Fundamental building blocks of SOA.
    * **Types:**
        * **Private Services:** Available only within an organization.
        * **Public Services**: Accessible over the internet.
    * **Features of a Service:**
        * **Service Implementation:** Code logic for specific functions (e.g., user authentication, bill calculation).
        * **Service Contract:** Defines service terms, prerequisites, cost, and quality.
        * **Service Interface:** Provides a communication mechanism for invoking services. Reduces dependencies between services and consumers.
* Service Provider:
    * Creates, maintains, and offers services.
    * Can be internal or third-party.
* Service Consumer:
    * Requests services from providers.
    * Can be systems, applications, or other services.
    * Interaction is governed by the service contract.
* Service Registry / Broker / Repository:
    * Network-accessible directory storing service descriptions.
    * Functions:
        * Service providers publish descriptions here.
        * Service consumers use it to discover required services.

### Key Benefits of SOA
* **Interoperability:** Services work across different platforms and languages.
* **Reusability:** Services can be reused in multiple applications.
* **Scalability:** Components can scale independently.
* **Flexibility:** Easy to update or replace individual services without affecting the entire system.
