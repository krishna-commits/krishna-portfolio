### Getting the Previous Command

Use the following command to retrieve the current system date from the Oracle database:

```bash
SQL> select sysdate from dual;

SYSDATE
---------
03-NOV-24

SQL> /

SYSDATE
---------
03-NOV-24
```

### Clearning the Screen
To clear the screen, use the following command:
```bash 
SQL> clear screen;
```

### View database name
```bash 

SQL> SELECT name FROM v$database;

NAME
---------
FREE
```
* The output you received (FREE) is the name of the current database you're connected to. It means that the database youâ€™re working with is named FREE.
* In Oracle, the v$database view provides the name and other metadata for the current database instance. The name FREE was likely assigned to this database during its creation, but it doesn't have any special significance in Oracle beyond being its identifier.


### Create Table 
```bash 
SQL> CREATE TABLE TOYS (
  2  TOY_NAME VARCHAR2(100),
  3  WEIGHT NUMBER
  4  );

Table created.
```
* The above command creates a new table named TOYS with two columns: TOY_NAME and WEIGHT

### Insert Command 
```bash
SQL> INSERT INTO TOYS VALUES ('Dog',1234);

1 row created.
```

### Select Syntax
```bash
SQL> SELECT * FROM TOYS ;

TOY_NAME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WEIGHT
----------
Dog
      1234

SQL> SELECT TOY_NAME FROM TOYS ;

TOY_NAME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dog


SQL> SELECT TOY_NAME,WEIGHT FROM TOYS ;

TOY_NAME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WEIGHT
----------
Dog
      1234
```
