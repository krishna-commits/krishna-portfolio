* **Key-value:** Stores data as key-value pairs, suitable for fast lookups (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
* **Graph database:** Models relationships between data using nodes, edges, and properties (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB).
* **Document-oriented:** Stores data as documents, typically in JSON or BSON format (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB).
* **Column-oriented:** Stores data in columns rather than rows, optimized for analytical queries (e.g., Cassandra, HBase).
