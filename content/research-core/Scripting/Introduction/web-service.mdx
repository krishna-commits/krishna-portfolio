* **Human Centric Web** : Focused on static content delivery and user interaction through traditional websites. 
* **Application-centric web** : emphasizing rich functionality and interactivity similar to desktop or mobile applications.

#### What kind of technology support is needed to move from human centric web to application centric web? What mechanisms do we need?
1. Service discovery mechanisms
* A way for the applications that need services to find providers of the services
2. Service description mechanism
* A way for the service clients to know what services providers provide
* A way for the providers of the services to describe the services they offer
3. Common standards 
* A way for service clients to communicate with service providers
* Interoperability support

### Web Service
A Web Service is a platform-independent service accessible over the internet or private intranets, enabling software applications to communicate and share resources using standard protocols and technologies.
#### Core Features of Web Services
* **Availability Over Networks**
    * Accessible via the Internet or private networks (e.g., intranets).
* **Standardized Messaging**
    * Operates using XML-based messaging systems, ensuring platform and language independence.
* **Platform and Language Neutrality**
    * Compatible across various operating systems and programming languages, fostering interoperability.
* **Resource Sharing**
    * Exposes software resources and functionalities over networks using standard communication protocols.
* **Standards-Based Integration**
    * Web services rely on established standards to enable seamless interactions among devices and applications, forming a cohesive, accessible system.

### Properties of Web Services
#### Self-Describing Web Services
A self-describing web service provides sufficient information for others to understand and integrate with it.
* Public Interface:
    * When publishing a new web service, it's essential to include a public interface that outlines how to interact with the service.
    * This interface should use a common XML grammar if the service employs SOAP, such as WSDL (Web Services Description Language).
* Human-Readable Documentation:
    * Comprehensive, clear documentation must accompany the web service.
    * This documentation enables developers and integrators to easily understand its functionality and requirements.

#### Discoverable Web Services
A discoverable web service ensures that potential users can find and access it with minimal effort.
* Publishing Mechanism:
    * A mechanism for announcing the availability of a service is essential.
    * The publishing method can range from decentralized approaches (peer-to-peer communication) to centralized registries (e.g., UDDI).
* Ease of Discovery:
    * Interested users or systems should be able to locate the service quickly.
    * Discovery processes might involve querying registries, browsing service directories, or utilizing automated discovery protocols.

### Web Service Roles
Three major roles in web services:
1. **Service Provider:**  provider of the web service.
2. **Service Requestor**:  any consumer of the web service.
3. **Service Registry:**  logically centralized directory of services.

### Web service protocol stack 
* **Service transport:** Responsible for transporting messages. Examples:  HTTP, BEEP
* **XML messaging:** Responsible for encoding messages in common XML format. Examples:  XML-RPC, SOAP
* **Service Description:** Responsible for describing an interface to a specific web service. Example:  WSDL
* **Service Discovery:** Responsible for centralizing services into a common search registry. Example:  UDDI.

### XML-RPC Example
```shell

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<methodCall>
   <methodName>weather.getWeather</methodName>
   <params>
      <param><value>10016</value></param>
   </params>
</methodCall>

# XML-RPC Response
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<methodResponse>

      </ns1:getWeather>
   </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>

# SOAP Response 
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope
   xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://www.w3.org/2001/09/soap-envelope/"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
   <SOAP-ENV:Body>
      <ns1:getWeatherResponse
         xmlns:ns1="urn:examples:weatherservice"
         SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle="http://www.w3.org/2001/09/soap-encoding/">
         <return xsi:type="xsd:int">65</return>
      </ns1:getWeatherResponse>
   </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```
| Part |	Purpose |	Optional? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Envelope |	Root element, defines message structure and namespaces | No |
| Header | Contains metadata (e.g., authentication, routing) | Yes |
| Body | Contains main message content (request/response) | No |
| Fault | Conveys error details when an issue occurs | Yes |

## WSDL:  Web Service Description Language.
* WSDL is an XML grammar for specifying an interface for a web service.
* Specifies 
    * location of web service
    * methods that are available by the web service
    * data type information for all XML messages
    * WSDL is commonly used to describe SOAP services.

## XML-RPC

### Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
RPC is a protocol or technique used to execute a procedure (subroutine or method) on a remote server as if it were a local procedure call. The key idea is to abstract the complexities of network communication, allowing developers to interact with remote services in a seamless way.

* **XML-RPC** is a simple protocol for carrying out remote proceedure calls (RPC) over TCP/IP 
* It uses two standards of the internet to create a standard way of calling remote web services and receiving a response
    * Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as a transport mechanism
    * eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to encode it’s calls
* XML-RPC offers a very simple, but frequently useful, set of tools for connecting disparate systems and for publishing machine-readable information
* **XML-RPC on the private network**
    * Systems integrators and programmers building distributed systems often use XML-RPC as glue code, connecting **disparate** parts of a private network
    * By using XML-RPC, developers can focus on the interfaces between systems, not the protocol used to connect those interfaces. 
* **XML-RPC on the public network**
    * Developers building public services can use XML-RPC, defining an interface and implementing it in the language of their choice
    * Once that service is published to the Web, any XML-RPC capable client can connect to that service, and developers can create their own applications that use that service.
* **What is XML-RPC**
    * It’s a specification
    * It’s a set of implementations that allow software running on disparate operating systems, running in different environments to make procedure calls over the internet
    * Its remote procedure calling using HTTP as the transport and XML as the encoding
* **How XML RPC Works ?**
    * A client performs an RPC by sending an HTTP request to a server that implements XML-RPC and receives the HTTP response
    * A call can have multiple parameters and one result
    * The protocol defines a few data types for the parameters and result
