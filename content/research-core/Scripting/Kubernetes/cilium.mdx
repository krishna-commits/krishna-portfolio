* One of the design principles of kubernetes is to isolate workloads, allowing multiple nodes to happily share the same infrastructure. 
* To provide this isolation, application within the kubernetes cluster doesn't use the underlying network. 
* Application sit under the internal network referred to as the pod network that is specified as a CIDR. 
* The pod network is not directly accessible from outside the cluster, and has the requirement that all the pods can communicate within the cluster. 

* This has introduced few problems: 
    * Who owns the kubernetes network. 
    * Often the infrastructure arent even aware of things like pod network. 
* What tools are available to trouble shoot the kubernetes network. 
* How do you observe the kubernetes network for checking performance or bottlenecks. 
* How do you enforce controls in the kubernetes network. 

### Kubernetes Networking
Requirements for kubernetes networking
1. Pods need to be able to communicate with one another. 
2. We need our application to be accessible (internally or externally). Two ways to access : NodePort, LoadBalancer.
3. Pods need to communicate with outside world.
