## A Brief Overview

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) pipelines are automated workflows that streamline software development, testing, and deployment. These pipelines help teams deliver high-quality software faster by integrating code changes frequently and deploying them reliably.

### Key Components of a CI/CD Pipeline

**Continuous Integration (CI)**

- Developers push code to a shared repository frequently.
- Automated tests validate code changes to detect issues early.
- A build process ensures that the application compiles successfully.

**Continuous Delivery (CD)**

- Code changes that pass CI are automatically prepared for deployment.
- Deployment to staging or production environments is triggered with minimal manual intervention.
- Every successful code change is automatically deployed to production without human approval.

**Benefits of CI/CD Pipelines**

- Faster development cycles and quicker feedback loops.
- Improved software quality with automated testing and validation.
- Reduced manual errors through automated deployments.
- Increased collaboration between development and operations teams (DevOps).
