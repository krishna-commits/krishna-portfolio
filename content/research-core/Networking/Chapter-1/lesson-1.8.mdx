# Juniper Command Cheat Sheet

This document presents a comprehensive list of Juniper commands, focusing on BGP, MPLS, and general routing management. It is an invaluable resource for network engineers and administrators involved in managing Juniper routers and switches.

The commands provided here are intended to assist in everyday network operations and advanced troubleshooting. They offer insights into protocol configurations, routing tables, and network diagnostics. Use these commands carefully, as they can affect network behavior and service delivery.


## BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) Management

- **show bgp summary**
  - Displays a summary of BGP peerings and their status.

- **show bgp neighbor [NEIGHBOR_IP]**
  - Shows detailed information about a specific BGP neighbor.

- **show route protocol bgp**
  - Displays BGP routes in the routing table.

- **show route receive-protocol bgp [NEIGHBOR_IP]**
  - Shows routes received from a specific BGP neighbor.

- **show route advertising-protocol bgp [NEIGHBOR_IP]**
  - Displays routes being advertised to a specific BGP neighbor.

- **show bgp group [GROUP_NAME]**
  - Displays configuration and statistics for a specific BGP group.

- **clear bgp neighbor [NEIGHBOR_IP]**
  - Clears a specific BGP session.

- **set protocols bgp group [GROUP_NAME] type [TYPE]**
  - Configures a BGP group with a specific type.

- **set protocols bgp group [GROUP_NAME] neighbor [NEIGHBOR_IP]**
  - Adds a neighbor to a BGP group.

- **show configuration protocols bgp**
  - Shows the BGP configuration.

- **show route advertising-protocol bgp [NEIGHBOR_IP] detail**
  - Shows detailed routes being advertised to a specific BGP neighbor.

- **show route receive-protocol bgp [NEIGHBOR_IP] detail**
  - Displays detailed routes received from a specific BGP neighbor.

## MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)

- **show mpls lsp**
  - Shows MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) information.

- **show mpls interface**
  - Displays MPLS interface information.

- **show route table mpls.0**
  - Displays the MPLS routing table.

- **show mpls lsp extensive**
  - Shows detailed information about MPLS LSPs.

- **show mpls lsp statistics**
  - Displays statistics for MPLS LSPs.

- **traceoptions flag mpls**
  - Enables MPLS-specific tracing options for debugging.

- **show route table inet.3**
  - Displays the MPLS forwarding table.

- **show mpls lsp name [LSP_NAME] detail**
  - Shows detailed information about a specific MPLS LSP.

- **set protocols mpls label-switched-path [LSP_NAME] to [DESTINATION]**
  - Configures an MPLS LSP.

- **monitor traffic interface [INTERFACE_NAME] no-resolve**
  - Monitors real-time traffic on a specified interface, useful for MPLS troubleshooting.

## Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB)

- **show interfaces irb**
  - Shows Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) interface information.
