# NETWORK PROTOCOLS

**Network protocols** are sets of rules or conventions that govern the communication between devices on a computer network. These protocols define the format, timing, sequencing, and error checking used during data transmission. Network protocols also determine how devices identify each other on the network and how they establish, maintain, and terminate connections. 

### Contents

This cheatsheet contains essential protocols and standards, including:
- Name of the protocol;
- Port number;
- TCP or UDP port usage;
- OSI layer;
- Essential functions;
- Possible vectors of attack;
- State of security.

The cheatsheet recognizes two states of security:

**1. Insecure**: This state is considered outdated and prone to attacks. These protocols should not be used unless there are exceptional circumstances where they must be implemented. However, in such cases, plenty of other security measures must also be included to make them safe.

**2. Secure**: This state is considered safe and should be implemented in secure environments. However, even though a protocol is considered secure, it may still be vulnerable to some attacks.

**IT IS ESSENTIAL TO NOTE THAT A PROTOCOL BEING CONSIDERED SECURE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT CANNOT BE EXPLOITED.**
