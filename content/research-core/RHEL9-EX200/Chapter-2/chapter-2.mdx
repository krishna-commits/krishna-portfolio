Shell Scripting is an open-source computer program designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell. Shell Scripting is a program to write a series of commands for the shell to execute. It can combine lengthy and repetitive sequences of commands into a single and simple script that can be stored and executed anytime which, reduces programming efforts.
This Shell Scripting tutorial helps to learn a basic understanding of the Linux/Unix shell scripting program to advanced concepts of Shell Scripting. This Shell Script tutorial designed for beginners and professionals who want to learn What is Shell Scripting? How shell scripting works, types of shell, and more.

#### Steps in creating a Shell Script:
- Create a file using a vi editor (or any other editor). Name script file with extension .sh
- Start the script with #! /bin/sh
- Write some code.
- Save the script file as filename.sh
- For executing the script type bash filename.sh

#### Example 1: Login as sanjeeb and create a directory /home/sanjeeb/Script and set this directory into PATH permanently. 
- Open `.bashrc`
- Add the command `export PATH=$PATH:/home/sanjeeb/Script`
- Refresh .bashrc `. .bashrc`
```bash /Script/
[sanjeeb@server ~]$ echo $PATH
/home/sanjeeb/.local/bin:/home/sanjeeb/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/scripts

[sanjeeb@server ~]$ cat .bashrc
...
export PATH=$PATH:/home/sanjeeb/Script

[sanjeeb@server ~]$ . .bashrc

[sanjeeb@server ~]$ echo $PATH 
/home/sanjeeb/.local/bin:/home/sanjeeb/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/scripts:/home/sanjeeb/Script:/home/sanjeeb/Script
```

- export is used to define as a global variable
- PATH=$PATH:< pathname > , Here $PATH is the previous path which is called

### To create systemwide path global variable

- Switch to root user
- Go to /etc/profile and edit this page
- Insert the line `PATH=$PATH:/home/sanjeeb/Script`
- Then exit the terminal and switch the another user
- Test if the script runs without profiding the full path

## Operators used in bash shell Scripting
### String Operators
- `=` : True, if both string 1 and string 2 are the same.
- `!=` : True, if both string 1 and string 2 are different.
- `-z String1` : True if the size of the string1 is zero.
- `-n String` : True if the size of the string1 is not zero.
### Numeric Operators
- `-eq` : True, if num1 = num2
- `-ne` : True, if num1 != num2 
- `-lt` : True, if num1 < num2 
- `-le` : True, if num1 < = num2
- `-gt` : True, if num1 > num2 
- `-ge` : True, if num1 > = num2  
### Logical Operators
- `-a` : Logical AND
- `-o` : Loginal OR
- `!` : Logical NOT
### File Operators
- `-e file1` : True, if file exists
- `-f file1` : True, if file exists and is a normal file 
- `-d dir1` : True, if it is a directory
- `-r file1` : True, if the file is readable
- `-w file1` : True, if the file is writable 
- `-x file1` : True, if the file is executable 
- `-s file1` : True, if the file size is not equal to zero
