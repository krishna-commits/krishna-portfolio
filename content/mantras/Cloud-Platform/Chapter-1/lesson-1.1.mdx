## Introduction to Ansible
Ansible is a powerful open-source automation tool that simplifies Linux system administration by enabling configuration management, software deployment, and task automation across multiple servers. It uses a declarative approach, meaning administrators define the desired system state, and Ansible ensures it is achieved without manual intervention.

### Why Automate Linux Administration?
Manual system administration is prone to errors, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies. Automating common tasks with Ansible provides:

* Consistency – Ensures uniform configuration across all systems.
* Scalability – Easily manage hundreds or thousands of servers.
* Efficiency – Reduces the time spent on repetitive administrative tasks.
* Security & Compliance – Enforces security policies and maintains system integrity.

### How Ansible Works
Ansible follows an agentless architecture, meaning it does not require additional software on managed nodes. It connects via SSH and executes automation tasks using YAML-based playbooks. Key components include:

* Inventory – A list of managed nodes (hosts).
* Modules – Predefined tasks that perform system actions (e.g., installing software, managing users).
* Playbooks – YAML scripts defining automation workflows.
* Roles – Structured collections of tasks, variables, and handlers for reusability.
